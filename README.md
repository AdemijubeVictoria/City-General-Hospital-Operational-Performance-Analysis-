- There is an overcrowded emergency department and patients and preparation. 
- Some staff are complaining of high workload.
- Medication stock is mismanaged leading to shortages and waste of expired excesses.
- High rate of inconclusive lab tests. 
- Insurance reimbursement is inconsistent.

 --- 

## Project Objective 
- To understand patient demographics.
- To examine admission types to detect patterns in emergency spikes.
- To evaluate doctor workload distribution.
- To assess medication utilization patterns.
- To find the root causes of inconclusive laboratory results
- To analyse billing and insurance data to uncover underpaying insurance providers

## Datasets 
-  **City Hospital Dataset.xlsx** — patient_id, age, gender, admission date, department

## Dashboard Features
- Key KPIs: total patients, total doctors, doctors to patient ratio, average admission duration, total billing amount
- Visuals: Patient Distribution by Age Group, Monthly Hospital Admission Trend, Hospital by Patient Volume, Top 10 Performing Doctors by Patient Load
- Interactivity: slicers for Gender, Age group, Test result

## Key Findings 
- The population is more of elderly (21,148).
- The admission types are almost evenly distributed.
